# KfoneStore

This app was created with Bootify.io - tips on working with the code [can be found here](https://bootify.io/next-steps/). Feel free to contact us for further questions.

## Development

During development it is recommended to use the profile `local`. In IntelliJ, `-Dspring.profiles.active=local` can be added in the VM options of the Run Configuration after enabling this property in "Modify options".

If necessary, create an `application-local.yml` file to override your own settings for development.

After starting the application it is accessible under `localhost:8080`.

## Build

The application can be built using the following command:

```
mvnw clean package
```

The application can then be started with the following command - here with the profile `production`:

```
java -Dspring.profiles.active=production -jar ./target/kfone-store-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
```
